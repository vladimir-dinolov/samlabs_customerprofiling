# SAM Labs Customer Profiling

## The "Why"
I currently work as a Marketing Analyst for an educational technology company called ‘SAM Labs’. The company specializes in hands-on STEAM and coding solutions for K-8 educators. As a Marketing team, we are focused on account-based marketing and segmenting our customers based on behavior, historical purchases, demographics, and finances. Data was gathered from our customer relationship management system, the National Center for Education Statistics, and GovSpend, a spending database that aggregates government agency purchase orders. Statistical models were used to identify and develop alternative marketing strategies based on competitor purchases and their significance in predicting a SAM Labs purchase. 

## About the Data 
Two datasets were pulled by PASSNYC from the New York Department of Education (NYDOE). The first is a database of thousands of schools across New York City and the second is SHSAT registration and testers. The raw data is comprised of 1,272 rows and 161 columns. Each row is an observation of variables such as state test scores, student demographics, school success indices, and location. This data is public data used to identify students within New York City’s underperforming school districts.

## Outcome 
This research produced a list of 100 school districts meeting the criteria for all or some of the statistically significant variables. Examples include purchases from specific competitors, the category of the item purchased, the type of school district purchasing, and the school district’s expenditures and revenue. The Marketing team has used this insight to shift its approach in nurturing leads, creating smart content, and reengage segments of customers that meet our customer profiles. 

After identifying customer profiles, I assisted the SAM Labs Marketing team in creating a ‘Solutions’ gateway on our company website. Each solution caters to a different subset of our customers. We also began to target school districts that receive federal STEM grants, as these grants were identified as of the most statistically significant variables associated with a SAM Labs purchase.
